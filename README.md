# HTML CHALLENGE 01

##What I did for the Code Refactor##

What I did was add the image locations, added the alt-text, and condensed the CSS. By also implementing CSS variables, I was able to further condense the code into one area which saved a ton of time as well.

## Challenges ##

I think the hardest parts of the challenge for me were two things. The first problem was getting the images to work because I did not know how to implement the images from my desktop to the html file!

The second and hardest part was trying to figure out what I should do. The reason why I struggled with this is because I wasn't sure how to condense the code since everything worked. However, when I reasearched how to condnse code from the modules and the internet, everything sped up by 100%.
